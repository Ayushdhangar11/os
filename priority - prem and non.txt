### Explanation of the Code

The code implements two types of **Priority Scheduling** algorithms: **Non-Preemptive** and **Preemptive** Priority Scheduling, used in operating systems for process scheduling. Below is a breakdown of each part of the code and its relation to **Operating Systems** concepts.

### Key Concepts in Operating Systems (OS)

**1. Process Scheduling**:
- In OS, **scheduling** refers to the way processes are assigned to the CPU for execution. The scheduler decides which process should run at a given time based on certain algorithms.
  
**2. Priority Scheduling**:
- **Priority Scheduling** assigns a priority level to each process. The process with the highest priority (lowest priority number) is selected for execution first.
  - **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**: If a new process arrives with a higher priority, it can preempt the currently running process.
  - **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**: Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion regardless of whether a new process with a higher priority arrives.

### Process Structure

The `struct Process` is used to represent each process. The structure contains:
- `pid`: Process ID, unique identifier for each process.
- `arrivalTime`: The time when the process arrives in the system.
- `burstTime`: The CPU time the process requires to complete its task.
- `remainingTime`: For preemptive scheduling, it tracks how much CPU time is left for the process.
- `priority`: The priority level of the process; lower numbers indicate higher priority.
- `finishTime`: The time at which the process finishes executing.
- `turnAroundTime`: The total time the process has spent in the system (Finish Time - Arrival Time).
- `waitingTime`: The time the process spent waiting in the ready queue (Turnaround Time - Burst Time).
- `isCompleted`: A flag to track whether the process has completed its execution.

### Function Breakdown

#### 1. **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling (Function `priorityNonPreemptive`)**

- **Initialization**: 
  - `currentTime`: Keeps track of the current time in the system, starting from 0.
  - `completed`: Keeps count of how many processes have been completed.

- **Main Loop**: 
  - The algorithm runs in a loop until all processes are completed.
  - For each process, it checks if the process has arrived (i.e., `arrivalTime <= currentTime`).
  - Among all processes that have arrived and are not yet completed, the process with the **highest priority** (smallest `priority` value) is selected for execution.

- **Process Execution**:
  - Once the process with the highest priority is selected, it executes to completion. 
  - The **finish time** is calculated as the sum of the `currentTime` and the `burstTime`.
  - The **turnaround time** and **waiting time** are also calculated:
    - Turnaround Time = Finish Time - Arrival Time.
    - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time.
  - The process is marked as completed (`isCompleted = true`), and `currentTime` is updated to the `finishTime`.

- **Idle Time**: 
  - If no process is available (none has arrived or all completed), the `currentTime` is incremented by 1, simulating idle time until the next process arrives.

#### 2. **Preemptive Priority Scheduling (Function `priorityPreemptive`)**

- **Initialization**:
  - Similar to the non-preemptive version, the `currentTime` is initialized to 0, and `completed` keeps track of the number of completed processes.

- **Main Loop**:
  - In each cycle, the algorithm checks for the process with the highest priority that has already arrived.
  - If such a process is found, one unit of time is allocated to it, reducing its remaining burst time by 1 (`remainingTime--`).
  - If a process’s `remainingTime` becomes zero, it is marked as completed, and the corresponding `finishTime`, `turnAroundTime`, and `waitingTime` are calculated, just like in the non-preemptive version.

- **Preemption**:
  - This is where the preemptive nature comes in: if another process arrives with a higher priority (lower `priority` value) before the current one finishes, it will be selected for execution, and the previously running process may resume execution later.
  - If no process is ready to execute, the `currentTime` is incremented by 1.

#### 3. **Display Results (Function `displayResults`)**

Once all processes are completed, the `displayResults` function prints the following for each process:
- **PID**: Process ID.
- **Arrival Time**: The time the process arrived in the system.
- **Burst Time**: The CPU time required by the process.
- **Priority**: The priority of the process.
- **Finish Time**: The time the process completed its execution.
- **Turnaround Time**: The total time the process was in the system.
- **Waiting Time**: The time the process spent waiting in the ready queue.

Additionally, it calculates the **average turnaround time** and **average waiting time** across all processes and prints them.

#### 4. **Main Function**

The `main` function serves as the entry point:
- It first asks for the number of processes `n` and takes the input for each process’s `arrivalTime`, `burstTime`, and `priority`.
- It then prompts the user to select either **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling** (option 1) or **Preemptive Priority Scheduling** (option 2).
- Based on the user’s choice, the respective scheduling function is called (`priorityNonPreemptive` or `priorityPreemptive`).
- Finally, the results are displayed by calling `displayResults`.

### Key OS Concepts Related to This Code

1. **Process Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - This code implements the **Priority Scheduling** algorithm, which is a preemptive or non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. It is useful in systems where processes have different levels of importance (priority), and those with higher priority should be executed first.

2. **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling**:
   - **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: Once a process starts executing, it runs to completion without being interrupted, even if a higher-priority process arrives.
   - **Preemptive Scheduling**: A running process can be interrupted (preempted) if a higher-priority process arrives.

3. **Turnaround Time and Waiting Time**:
   - **Turnaround Time** is the total time taken from process arrival to completion. 
   - **Waiting Time** is the time a process spends waiting in the ready queue (Turnaround Time - Burst Time).

4. **CPU Scheduling**:
   - The main objective of CPU scheduling is to ensure that the CPU is utilized efficiently and that processes are executed in a fair and timely manner. Priority Scheduling helps achieve this by giving precedence to critical tasks.

In summary, this code simulates priority-based process scheduling for an operating system, with both preemptive and non-preemptive versions, and calculates relevant performance metrics (waiting time and turnaround time) for each process.
